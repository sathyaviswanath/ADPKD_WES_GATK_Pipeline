# ADPKD WES GATK Pipeline Overview
The ADPKD Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) pipeline processes paired-end read data to detect high-confidence SNPs and indels in PKD1/PKD2 regions on chromosomes 4 and 16.

## Scientific Context

**Raw Sequencing Data:** Public SRA dataset SRR21384731 (Illumina paired-end WES) from NCBI SRA.

**Reference Genome and Known Sites**

**Reference:** GRCh38.p14 chromosome FASTA files (chr4.fna.gz, chr16.fna.gz) from NCBI, merged into chr4chr16.fa for targeted analysis of ADPKD genes.​

**Known sites:** dbSNP138 (hg38) VCF restricted to chr4 and chr16, then contigs renamed to NC accessions for use in base quality score recalibration (BQSR).

## Pipeline Workflow Summary

Raw FASTQ
→ Quality Control (FastQC, FastP)
→ Read Alignment (BWA-MEM)
→ BAM Processing (Duplicate marking, indexing)
→ Base Recalibration (GATK BQSR)
→ Variant Calling (GATK HaplotypeCaller)
→ Variant Filtering (SNP/INDEL hard filtering, selection of PASS calls)
→ Variant Annotation Preparation (ANNOVAR input and database download)

## Pipeline Purpose

- To Generate high-quality, analysis-ready variant call sets focused on ADPKD-associated genomic regions on chr4 and chr16.

- To Reduce computational overhead by restricting the genome to relevant chromosomes while still applying GATK best-practice steps.

- To Provide standardized outputs (BAM, VCF, annotation-ready files) that can be reused for downstream clinical or research interpretation.

## Outputs

**1. QC Reports**

- FastQC HTML reports for raw and trimmed reads in Outputs/.

- FastP HTML and JSON reports summarizing trimming and quality metrics.​

**2. Alignment and BAM Files**

- **Reference:** chr4chr16.fa, index files, and sequence dictionary.

- **Processed BAM:** SRR2138473_sorted_dedup_reads.bam and SRR2138473_sorted_dedup_BQSR.bam plus index files.​

**3. Variant Files**

- **Raw variant VCF:** SRR2138473_raw_variants.vcf.

- Filtered and PASS-only SNP and INDEL VCFs (analysis-ready).

- ANNOVAR .avinput files for downstream annotation.​

**4. Annotation Databases**

- ANNOVAR humandb/ directory with hg38 refGene and related annotation resources.
